Hence the family of all solutions is\n    \\[\n      \\bigl(3x,\\;5x,\\;64 - 8x\\bigr),\\quad\n      \\text{for any real }x>0\\text{ with }64-8x>0\\text{ and the three triangle‐inequalities.}\n    \\]\n   For example, if you restrict to integer‐length sides you find exactly two choices of integer \\(x\\), namely \\(x=5\\) (giving sides \\(15,25,24\\)) or \\(x=6\\) (giving sides \\(18,30,16\\)).  But without even imposing integrality, there is an infinite one‐parameter family of solutions.\n\nBecause the problem as stated has infinitely many solutions, one cannot give a single numerical triple \\((a,b,c)\\).  You can only express the general solution in terms of the free parameter \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef simple_math_problem() -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    The ratio of the lengths of two sides of a triangle is 3:5. If the perimeter of the triangle\n    is equal to 64 cm, what are the lengths of the sides?\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let x be an arbitrary positive scale factor.\n    # Then the two sides in the given ratio are:\n    side1 = 3 * x  # length of first side\n    side2 = 5 * x  # length of second side\n\n    # The third side must make the perimeter 64:\n    side3 = 64 - (side1 + side2)\n\n    print(\"General solution (in terms of x):\")\n    print(f\"  Side lengths = (3x, 5x, 64 - 8x).\")\n    print(\"To get a valid triangle, x must satisfy:\")\n    print(\"  1) 64 - 8x > 0                     (so side3 > 0)\")\n    print(\"  2) 3x + 5x > 64 - 8x,\")\n    print(\"     3x + (64 - 8x) > 5x,\")\n    print(\"     5x + (64 - 8x) > 3x            (the triangle inequalities).\")\n\n    # Example: for integer solutions, one finds x = 5 or x = 6:\n    #   x = 5 => sides = (15, 25, 24)\n    #   x = 6 => sides = (18, 30, 16)\n\n    # Since the problem as stated is underdetermined, we do not return a single numeric result.\n    return None\n```\n\nExplanation of the code:\n- We introduce `x` as the free positive parameter.  \n- We express the two sides as `3*x` and `5*x`, and the third side as `64 - 8*x`.  \n- We then print the general form of the solution and the conditions under which a valid triangle is formed.  \n- We note that, if one further demands integer side‐lengths, only two integer values of `x` (namely 5 and 6) work, yielding sides (15, 25, 24) or (18, 30, 16).
