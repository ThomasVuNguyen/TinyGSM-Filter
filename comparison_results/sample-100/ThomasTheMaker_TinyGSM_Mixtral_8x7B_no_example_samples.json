We define a function called `simple_math_problem` that takes no arguments and returns a float.\n2. Inside the function, we assign the total number of pencils (40) to the variable `total_pencils`.\n3. We calculate the number of pencils given away by multiplying the total number of pencils by 25% (0.25), and assign it to the variable `pencils_given_away`.\n4. We calculate the number of pencils left by subtracting the number of pencils given away from the total number of pencils, and assign it to the variable `pencils_left`.\n5. We set the result to be the number of pencils left.\n6. We return the result.\n7. Finally, we print the result outside the function.",
