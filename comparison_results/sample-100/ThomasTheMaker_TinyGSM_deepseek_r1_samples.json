The question asks for the number of jackets that are neither leather nor puffer.\n\nTo solve this:\n1. The jackets that are either leather or puffer would be the sum of the two categories if there is no overlap (i.e., no jacket is counted in both categories).\n2. Adding the leather and puffer jackets: 215 + 212 = 427.\n3. Subtract this sum from the total jackets: 453 - 427 = 26.\n4.
