That means, the third participant took:\n\n    # total_items_taken = initial_total - 45\n    # Two participants took 9, so third took up to maximum 12, so x must be between 0 and 12 (from possible maximum per rules).\n\n    # But since not asked for possible maximum, just calculation.\n\n    # So, did the checkpoint start with enough for all?\n    # Is it possible to get multiple answers unless original total is sufficient.\n\n    # To infer, perhaps all three together took less than total available.\n\n    # Thus, the answer is:\n\n    # third_person_items = initial_total - items_left - first_person_items - second_person_items\n\n    # But as initial_total = items_left + total_taken\n\n    # But since total_taken = first_person_items + second_person_items + x\n\n    # Initial_total = items_left + first_person_items + second_person_items + x\n\n    # Unless initial_total is specified, there could be infinitely many answers\n\n    # But perhaps the question means: \"After three people have taken items, with two taking 9 each, how many did the third take if 45 remain?\"\n\n    # So, the total taken is initial_total - 45\n\n    # Since only asked for x, and two took 9 each, so x = (initial_total - 45) - 18\n\n    # If the original total is not specified, but only two took 9, third took (original_total - 45 - 18) = x\n\n    # But unless more is specified, need to give 'x' in terms of initial total.\n\n    # But perhaps the intended meaning is the initial total is not necessary -- just asking \"if after all three, 45 left and two took 9 each, how many did third take?\"\n\n    # So all three together took = initial_total - 45\n    # two took 9 each, so total for them is 18\n    # third took x\n    # So:\n    # 18 + x = initial_total - 45\n    # x = initial_total - 45 - 18 = initial_total - 63\n\n    # But unless initial_total is specified, x cannot be calculated.\n\n    # Is it possible to rephrase more simply? From the question, perhaps intended initial_total is 63 (since each can take up to 12, so 36 max possible taken, but after 3 have gone, there's 45 left, so perhaps started with at least 63).\n\n    # Since after taking, 45 left, means total taken = initial_total - 45\n\n    # two took 9, so total taken so far is 18\n    # third took x\n    # So:\n    # total_taken = 18 + x\n    # total_taken = initial_total - 45\n\n    # To get the answer, we need initial_total.\n\n    # Perhaps, the implicit assumption is that the items present at the checkpoint just before they arrived was total_taken + items_left = original items available.\n\n    # But the actual question doesn't require the initial count to answer; the missing variable is x and the only relevant ones are total taken and items left after all three left -- given their individual pick count.\n\n    # So:\n\n    # two took 9 each: 18\n    # items left: 45\n    # let third took x\n    # total items taken: 18 + x\n\n    # Since the sum taken plus what is left is the initial available, the items taken must account for all the rest beyond the 45 left\n\n    # But if three participants left at the same time and only 45 items remain, and two of them took 9 each, and the rest was taken by the third, so the third took whatever was possible within the maximum.\n\n    # So, total items taken = initial_total - items_left = items taken by participants\n\n    # items_taken = initial_total - 45\n\n    # Since only two took 9 each, remainder (third's) is:\n    # x = items_taken - 18\n\n    # But since x is not specified (if initial_total not specified), cannot answer numerically.\n\n    # If we assume that the available items were just enough for the three participants, i.e. initial_total = items_taken + items_left = (18 + x) + 45, no more, so x can be any number.\n\n    # But perhaps, the question expects:\n    # \"After all three have taken items, and two took 9 each, and 45 are left, how many did the third take?\"\n    # That is, x = initial_total - 45 - 18; but since initial_total is not specified, so unless we assume initial_total is just enough for all three, then,\n    # total_taken = initial_total - 45\n    # two took 9, so third took x = (initial_total - 45 - 18)\n    # If initial_total is not given, perhaps the only possible answer is x = initial_total - 45 - 18.\n\n    # But to get a numeric value, perhaps the problem intends us to note that the sum of items taken plus remaining equals initial available, and perhaps that the whole process took as much as taken.\n\n    # So perhaps the intended answer is, for 'items taken by third participant' = total_taken - 18 = (original available - 45) - 18\n\n    # Given that, perhaps in the problem as originally written:\n\n    # For three participants, each can take up to a maximum of 12, but two took 9 each, the third took x, and after all three, there are 45 items left.\n\n    # So:\n    # Items taken by three participants = original_items - items_left; original_items = items_taken + items_left\n    # items_taken = first_person_items + second_person_items + x\n\n    # original_items = items_left + first_person_items + second_person_items + x\n\n    # But no starting number is specified.\n\n    # In the context of the problem, perhaps the implicit assumption is that three participants came, took their respective items, and after all three, there are 45 left.

But no rate is given.\n    # So, the answer cannot be computed.\n    \n    # The only possible way to solve this would be if we assumed that 'needs to turn the crank for at least 15 minutes'\n    # means, regardless of rotations, he needs to crank for 15 minutes, perhaps at his current rate.\n    # THEN, maybe, we could estimate his average rotation rate by dividing number of rotations by minutes spent so far\n    # But we are not given minutes spent so far.\n    \n    # -----\n    # Therefore, since this is a logic trap in the question, let's clarify:\n    # There is enough info to say that more info is needed!\n    \n    # But if you are supposed to ignore the rotor, and just count crank rotations, and if the crank has to be turned\n    # for 15 minutes, and he has already done 900, maybe the goal is 'how many crank rotations in 15 min?'\n    # So let's solve for crank rotations over 15 minutes.\n    # If he has to turn the crank for 15 minutes, but the RPM is not given, the problem is incomplete.\n    # The 50 rotor rotations per crank turn is a distractor.\n\n    # Therefore, if you assume just crank rotations:\n    # If we assume the rate is 1 rotation per second (for example)--15 min * 60 = 900 rotations\n    # In that case, he already did 900, so he needs 0 more. But it's not stated.\n\n    # Therefore, the answer is None (not enough info).\n\n    return None\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe problem does not provide the crank rotation rate per minute, so the *total number of crank rotations needed to reach 15 minutes* cannot be calculated. The information is incomplete. If you have the RPM or the crank speed, the rest can be solved. The \"for every turn, his rotor rotates 50 times\" is a distractor and not needed for crank rotations. \n\nIf you want to *assume* 1 rotation/sec (as an example), you could do the math:\n- 15 min × 60 sec = 900 seconds → 900 crank rotations required  \n- He has already done 900 → 0 more needed\n\nBut since RPM is **not given**, best answer is `None`.",
