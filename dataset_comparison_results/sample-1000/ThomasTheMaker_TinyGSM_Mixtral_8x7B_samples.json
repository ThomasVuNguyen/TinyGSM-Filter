The variable `total_animals` is assigned the value of 120, which is the total number of animals in the park. The variable `fraction_of_dogs` is assigned the value of 2/5, which is the fraction of the total number of animals that are dogs.\n\nNext, the number of dogs is calculated by multiplying the total number of animals by the fraction of dogs. The number of cats is then calculated by subtracting the number of dogs from the total number of animals.\n\nFinally, the result is assigned the value of the number of cats and returned.",

We can do this by using the `//` operator in Python, which performs integer (also known as floor) division. This divides the numerator by the denominator and returns the largest whole number that is not greater than the result. In this case, we divide the total baking time available (20 hours) by the baking time for type A cakes (2 hours), which results in 10. This means that the bakery can make at most 10 type A cakes in a day if they don't make any type B cakes.",
