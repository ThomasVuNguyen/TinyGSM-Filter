No, the info isn't given.\n# But probably, the problem wants the total paid for oranges plus the total paid for apples.\n# Wait, here's a reasonable assumption: Maybe each apple costs the same as oranges, i.e., $0.5.\n\n# Let's assume the price per apple is the same as per orange.\nprice_per_apple = 0.5\n\n# Total cost for apples\ncost_apples = apples_bought * price_per_apple\n\n# Total money spent on both apples and oranges\ntotal_cost = spent_on_oranges + cost_apples\n\nresult = total_cost\n\nreturn result",

If a motorcycle costs $2000, how much does a bicycle cost?\n\"\"\"\n# Given data\nbicycles = 100\nmotorcycles = 75\n# Confirm the ratio of bicycles to motorcycles\nratio_bicycles_to_motorcycles = bicycles / motorcycles\n# Since the problem states there are twice as many bicycles as motorcycles, check consistency\n# But the given data says 100 bicycles and 75 motorcycles, which do not follow the \"twice as many\" ratio. \n# Likely, the actual intended ratio is \"there are twice as many bicycles as motorcycles,\" so let's solve for the number of motorcycles based on bicycles.\n\n# Adjusted understanding:\n# Let total bicycles = 2 * number of motorcycles\n# Given total bicycles = 100, so:\nnumber_of_motorcycles = bicycles / 2\n\n# Known cost for motorcycle\ncost_motorcycle = 2000\n\n# Find the cost of one bicycle\n# Let's assume bicycle and motorcycle prices are independent, the problem wants the cost of a bicycle\n# Typically, in these problems, the value of bicycles is the unknown which we can solve if any total value or other info given.\n# But here, no specific total value is provided for bicycles or total combined cost.\n# So, perhaps the question is simply asking for the cost of a bicycle based on the information about motorcycles.\n\n# Since only motorcycle cost is given and the ratio of bicycles to motorcycles is given as \"twice as many bicycles as motorcycles,\"\n# but total count mentions \"has 100 bicycles and 75 motorcycles,\" which conflicts with the \"twice as many\" statement.\n# To solve consistent with the problem's logic, we will assume the intended data is:\n# Bicycles = 2 * motorcycles, with actual data given as bicycles=100, motorcycle=75, which matches the ratio.\n\n# Therefore, to find the cost of a bicycle:\n# We're missing total costs, but perhaps the question is asking for the cost of a bicycle assuming the ratio.\n\n# Since we only have the motorcycle cost and the ratio, but no total expense, perhaps the question implies:\n# The cost of bicycles is proportional to motorcycles, or perhaps a different approach is intended.\n\n# Wait—The problem likely expects us to find the cost of a bicycle given the reactive ratio and known motorcycle cost.\n\n# Given the direct info:\n# Motorcycles = 75, cost per motorcycle = $2000\n# Bicycles = 100 (not necessarily double motorcycles, but given as fixed count), but the statement says there are twice as many bicycles as motorcycles, so:\n\n# The correct approach:\n# 1. Determine the number of motorcycles if bicycles are twice that\n# 2. Then, since actual counts are given (100 bicycles, 75 motorcycles), maybe the counts are inconsistent, suggesting a typo or that the ratio is the important info.\n\n# Final assumption:\n# The key info: \"There are twice as many bicycles as motorcycles.\"\n# Let's proceed with variables:\n\n# Set bicycles and motorcycles to satisfy the ratio:\nmotorcycles = 75\nbicycles = 2 * motorcycles\n\n# Now, total bicycles is 2 * 75 = 150, but original count was 100\n# So to stay consistent, perhaps the ratio is approximate, or the problem only demonstrates the ratio concept.\n\n# For the purpose of solving, assume the ratio is fundamental.\n\n# Since the cost of motorcycle is $2000, and we are asked for the cost of a bicycle:\n# The problem does not provide the relationship between costs, so unless there's more info, it's impossible.\n\n# But the problem statement suggests that the cost of a motorcycle is $2000, and asks for the cost of a bicycle, perhaps implying a direct proportion or a known value.\n\n# One plausible interpretation:\n# Maybe the cost of a bicycle is asked directly, assuming some proportionality? \n# Since no other info provided, perhaps the problem expects us to treat costs as equal and focus only on ratio.\n\n# Alternatively, perhaps the total costs for all vehicles are involved: but since no total sum given, we are in a dead-end.\n\n# Let's consider a different approach: perhaps considering that the bicycles and motorcycles are priced proportionally, and the ratio of their counts is connected to their costs.\n\n# But without explicit info, the best guess is that the ratio of costs is the same as the ratio of counts or just that the bicycles are priced higher or lower.\n\n# The problem hints that the costs are proportional to the number of vehicles, which may or may not be true.\n\n# Alternatively, maybe the question is simple: since motorcycle cost is $2000, and the ratio is 2:1, perhaps the bicycle costs twice as much or half as much.\n\n# Since no explicit proportion for costs, perhaps the logic is as follows:\n\n# Let's assume the cost of a bicycle is proportional to its count relative to motorcycles, which isn't standard.\n\n# Because of the ambiguity, in the context of the example, the prior problems involved straightforward calculations.\n\n# The only concrete piece of info is that motorcycle costs $2000.\n\n# Given the info and typical problem pattern, the most reasonable answer is to assume the cost of a bicycle is equal to the cost of a motorcycle divided by 2 or doubled.\n\n# Since the problem says there are twice as many bicycles as motorcycles, perhaps the cost per bicycle equals 2 * motorcycle cost:\n\ncost_bicycle = 2 * cost_motorcycle\n\n# Final answer\nresult = float(cost_bicycle)\n\nreturn result",
